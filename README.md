# WGCNA Network analysis with WGCNA weighted gene correlation networks for analysis
There are many gene correlation network builders but we shall provide an example of the WGCNA R Package.

The WGCNA R package builds “weighted gene correlation networks for analysis” from expression data. Here all the scripts I have given that are the scripts I wrote while doing my own analysis while working at Yasmin Hurd lab at Mount Sinai hospital.

WGCNA was originally published in 2008 and cited as the following:

Langfelder, P. and Horvath, S., 2008. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis. BMC bioinformatics, 9(1), p.559.
